A simple `C#` (Windows Forms) application that simulates classical celestial mechanics using Jupiter and its four Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

The simulation employs the Euler method within an object-oriented model to compute velocity vectors and celestial bodies' positions. While not suitable for high-precision research due to the algorithm's limitations, its simplicity makes it ideal for educational purposes.
